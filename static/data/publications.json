    "abstract": "The scientific cyberinfrastructure community heavily relies on public internet-based systems (e.g., GitHub) to share resources and collaborate. GitHub is one of the most powerful and popular systems for open source collaboration that allows users to share and work on projects in a public space for accelerated development and deployment. Monitoring GitHub for exposed vulnerabilities can save financial cost and prevent misuse and attacks of cyberinfrastructure. Vulnerability scanners that can interface with GitHub directly can be leveraged to conduct such monitoring. This research aims to proactively identify vulnerable communities within scientific cyberinfrastructure. We use social network analysis to construct graphs representing the relationships amongst users and repositories. We leverage prevailing unsupervised graph embedding algorithms to generate graph embeddings that capture the network attributes and nodal features of our repository and user graphs. This enables the clustering of public cyberinfrastructure repositories and users that have similar network attributes and vulnerabilities. Results of this research find that major scientific cyberinfrastructures have vulnerabilities pertaining to secret leakage and insecure coding practices for high-impact genomics research. These results can help organizations address their vulnerable repositories and users in a targeted manner."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of new technologies, vulnerabilities are at an all-time high. Companies are investing in developing Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) to counteract these new vulnerabilities. However, this CTI is generally reactive based on internal data. Hacker forums can provide proactive CTI value through automated analysis of new trends and exploits. One way to identify exploits is by analyzing the source code that is posted on these forums. These source code snippets are often noisy and unlabeled, making standard data labeling techniques ineffective. This study aims to design a novel framework for the automated collection and categorization of hacker forum exploit source code. We propose a deep transfer learning framework, the Deep Transfer Learning for Exploit Labeling (DTL-EL). DTL-EL leverages the learned representation from professional labeled exploits to better generalize to hacker forum exploits. This model classifies the collected hacker forum exploits into eight predefined categories for proactive and timely CTI. The results of this study indicate that DTL-EL outperforms other prominent models in hacker forum literature."

These can include vulnerabilities undetectable by conventional vulnerability scanners. This research aims to identify the installed applications, their vulnerabilities, and how they vary across images in scientific cyberinfrastructure. We propose a novel unsupervised graph embedding framework that captures relationships between applications, as well as vulnerabilities identified on corresponding GitHub repositories. This embedding is used to cluster images with similar applications and vulnerabilities. We evaluate cluster quality using Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, and Davies-Bouldin indices, and application vulnerabilities through inspection of selected clusters. Results reveal that images pertaining to genomics research in our research testbed are at greater risk of high-severity shell spawning and data validation vulnerabilities."

Increasingly, law enforcement agencies are using social network analysis (SNA) to identify key hackers from Dark Web hacker forums for targeted investigations. However, past approaches have primarily focused on analyzing key hackers at a single point in time and use a hacker\u2019s structural features only. In this study, we propose a novel Hacker Evolution Identification Framework to identify how hackers evolve within hacker forums. The proposed framework has two novelties in its design. First, the framework captures features such as user statistics, node-level metrics, lexical measures, and post style, when representing each hacker with unsupervised graph embedding methods. Second, the framework incorporates mechanisms to align embedding spaces across multiple time-spells of data to facilitate analysis of how hackers evolve over time. Two experiments were conducted to assess the performance of prevailing graph embedding algorithms and nodal feature variations in the task of graph reconstruction in five time-spells. Results of our experiments indicate that Text-Associated Deep-Walk (TADW) with all of the proposed nodal features outperforms methods without nodal features in terms of Mean Average Precision in each time-spell. We illustrate the potential practical utility of the proposed framework with a case study on an English forum with 51,612 posts. The results produced by the framework in this case study identified key hackers posting piracy assets."

    "abstract": "Malicious cyber activities impose substantial costs on the U.S. economy and global markets. Cyber-criminals often use information-sharing social media platforms such as paste sites (e.g., Pastebin) to share vast amounts of plain text content related to Personally Identifiable Information (PII), credit card numbers, exploit code, malware, and other sensitive content. Paste sites can provide targeted Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) about potential threats and prior breaches. In this research, we propose a novel Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to categorize pastes automatically. Our proposed BERT-LDA model leverages a neural network transformer architecture to capture sequential dependencies when representing each sentence in a paste. BERT-LDA replaces the Bag-of-Words (BoW) approach in the conventional LDA with a Bag-of-Labels (BoL) that encompasses class labels at the sequence level. We compared the performance of the proposed BERT-LDA against the conventional LDA and BERT-LDA variants (e.g., GPT2-LDA) on 4,254,453 pastes from three paste sites. Experiment results indicate that the proposed BERT-LDA outperformed the standard LDA and each BERT-LDA variant in terms of perplexity on each paste site. Results of our BERT-LDA case study suggest that significant content relating to hacker community activities, malicious code, network and website vulnerabilities, and PII are shared on paste sites. The insights provided by this study could be used by organizations to proactively mitigate potential damage on their infrastructure."

Decision aids (e.g., AI agents) can assist managers in avoiding EoC scenarios. However, how AI-based decision aids affect EoC in this context remains a critical yet understudied topic. To address this gap, we develop a theoretical model and propose a randomized controlled post-test vignette experiment with a fictive decision-making simulation to study the de-escalating effect of an AI-based decision aid in the digital innovation context. Our model accounts for moderating (AI familiarity, personality traits) and mediating (decision aid reliance) factors. By entangling the de-escalating effect of AI agent decision aid in decision-making scenarios about digital innovation projects we contribute to the digital innovation, AI agent, and the EoC literature. The future implementation of the proposed research design lays the foundation for designing AI agent decision support systems that de-bias managerial decision-making."

We also target a sample of college-age students from the United States instead of from Germany. The results of our replication support six of the seven hypotheses from the original paper.

In this study, we adopted the computational design science paradigm to develop a novel information technology artifact, the Deep Transfer Learning Exploit Labeler (DTL-EL). DTL-EL incorporates a pre-initialization design, multi-layer deep transfer learning (DTL), and a self-attention mechanism to automatically label exploits in hacker forums. We rigorously evaluated the proposed DTL-EL against state-of-the-art non-DTL benchmark methods based in classical machine learning and deep learning. Results suggest that the proposed DTL-EL significantly outperforms benchmark methods based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Our proposed DTL-EL framework provides important practical implications for key stakeholders such as cybersecurity managers, analysts, and educators."

    "abstract": "Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled new opportunities to automate media analysis and improve collaborative social cybersecurity. A key task is bias detection in news reporting, which is essential for promoting information fairness and reducing polarization. However, existing approaches often rely on supervised fine-tuning with labeled datasets and fail to capture domain-specific linguistic patterns, limiting scalability and generalization. To address this, we propose a lightweight, modular framework that combines domain-adaptive pretraining (DAP) with Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and soft prompt tuning to detect six types of media bias (framing, group, semantic properties, connotation, informational spin, and phrasing). Our framework leverages 401,000+ New York Times articles from 2000 to 2024 to pretrain five LLMs, followed by bias prompting with small labeled data. The approach improves F1 by 7.6% and precision by 6.8% over hard prompts on average across the six types of biases."

    "abstract": "Protected Health Information (PHI, e.g., electronic health records, insurance information) is increasingly stolen in data breaches by malicious actors with the intent to sell to others in hacker communities. These actors often protect themselves by describing the content and availability of PHI data using encrypted messaging platforms (e.g., Telegram & Discord). In this research, we propose a Named Entity Recognition Framework for PHI (NERF-PHI) to systematically analyze PHI-related hacker conversations. We collected more than three million multilingual hacker posts from Discord servers and Telegram groups. Utilizing open-source machine translation tools, we translated conversations to English and extracted information related to vulnerable individuals and medical entities. Results suggest that encoder-based Large Language Models show significant promise for extracting PHI-related information from hacker communities."
