## Abstract

Cybersecurity risk management has become increasingly complex as organizations face sophisticated and evolving threats. This paper presents a computational design science approach for improving threat mitigation through a comprehensive cybersecurity risk management framework. We develop a systematic methodology that combines design science principles with computational techniques to enhance cybersecurity risk assessment and mitigation strategies.

Our research addresses the challenges of:
- **Risk Assessment**: Comprehensive evaluation of cybersecurity risks
- **Design Science Methodology**: Systematic approach to framework development
- **Computational Techniques**: Integration of advanced computational methods
- **Threat Mitigation**: Practical strategies for reducing cybersecurity risks

The framework provides a structured approach to cybersecurity risk management and demonstrates improved effectiveness in threat mitigation.

## Key Contributions

1. **Computational Design Science Framework**: Novel methodology combining design science and computational techniques
2. **Risk Assessment Model**: Comprehensive approach to cybersecurity risk evaluation
3. **Mitigation Strategies**: Practical methods for threat reduction
4. **Systematic Methodology**: Structured approach to cybersecurity risk management

## Research Impact

This work advances the field of cybersecurity risk management and provides organizations with practical tools for improving their security posture.
