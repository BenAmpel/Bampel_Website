## Abstract

The protection of health information is critical in cybersecurity, particularly as healthcare data becomes increasingly valuable to malicious actors. This paper presents a novel approach for automatically extracting protected health information (PHI) from multilingual hacker communities using advanced machine learning techniques.

Our research addresses the challenges of:
- **Multilingual Processing**: Handling PHI across different languages and scripts
- **Context Awareness**: Understanding the context in which health information appears
- **Privacy Protection**: Ensuring compliance with healthcare privacy regulations
- **Real-time Detection**: Providing timely identification of PHI exposure

The framework demonstrates high accuracy in identifying PHI across multiple languages while maintaining low false positive rates.

## Key Contributions

1. **Multilingual Framework**: Development of language-agnostic PHI detection
2. **Context-Aware Analysis**: Understanding PHI within broader communication contexts
3. **Privacy Compliance**: Ensuring adherence to healthcare privacy standards
4. **Real-time Capabilities**: Providing immediate PHI detection and alerting

## Research Impact

This work contributes to the protection of healthcare data in cyberspace and provides tools for organizations to monitor and protect sensitive health information.
