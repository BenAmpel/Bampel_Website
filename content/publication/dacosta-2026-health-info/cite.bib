  abstract={This paper presents a novel approach for automatically extracting protected health information (PHI) from multilingual hacker communities. We develop a multi-task relation learning framework that can identify and categorize PHI across different languages and contexts. The protection of health information is critical in cybersecurity, particularly as healthcare data becomes increasingly valuable to malicious actors. Our research addresses the challenges of multilingual processing, context awareness, privacy protection, and real-time detection. The framework demonstrates high accuracy in identifying PHI across multiple languages while maintaining low false positive rates.},
