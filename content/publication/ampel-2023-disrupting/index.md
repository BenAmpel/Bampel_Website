## Abstract

Ransomware attacks have become increasingly sophisticated, often using cryptocurrency payments to evade traditional financial tracking. This paper presents a graph embedding approach for disrupting ransomware actors on the Bitcoin blockchain. We develop an innovative system that analyzes blockchain transactions to identify and track ransomware-related activities.

Our research addresses the challenges of:
- **Blockchain Analysis**: Tracking cryptocurrency transactions for ransomware payments
- **Graph Embedding**: Representing complex transaction networks as embeddings
- **Ransomware Detection**: Identifying patterns associated with ransomware activities
- **Actor Disruption**: Strategies for disrupting ransomware operations

The system demonstrates effectiveness in identifying ransomware actors and provides tools for law enforcement and security researchers.

## Key Contributions

1. **Graph Embedding Framework**: Novel approach for blockchain transaction analysis
2. **Ransomware Detection**: Identification of ransomware-related transaction patterns
3. **Actor Tracking**: Methods for tracking ransomware actors across the blockchain
4. **Disruption Strategies**: Practical approaches for disrupting ransomware operations

## Research Impact

This work advances the field of blockchain security and provides practical tools for combating ransomware attacks through cryptocurrency analysis.
