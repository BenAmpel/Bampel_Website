## Abstract

The MITRE ATT&CK framework has become a standard taxonomy for understanding cyber adversary behavior, but manually mapping exploit code to ATT&CK techniques is time-consuming and error-prone. This paper presents a multi-label transformer approach for automatically mapping exploit code found on paste sites to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Our research addresses the challenges of:
- **Automatic Classification**: Mapping exploit code to appropriate ATT&CK techniques
- **Multi-label Learning**: Handling multiple technique classifications per exploit
- **Transformer Architecture**: Leveraging advanced NLP techniques for code analysis
- **Paste Site Analysis**: Processing and analyzing code from various paste sites

The system demonstrates high accuracy in mapping exploit code to ATT&CK techniques and provides valuable intelligence for threat analysts.

## Key Contributions

1. **Multi-label Transformer Framework**: Novel approach for exploit code classification
2. **ATT&CK Mapping**: Automatic mapping to standardized threat taxonomy
3. **Paste Site Integration**: Analysis of code from various online sources
4. **Intelligence Generation**: Valuable insights for threat analysts

## Research Impact

This work advances the field of automated threat intelligence and provides practical tools for mapping exploit code to standardized threat frameworks.
