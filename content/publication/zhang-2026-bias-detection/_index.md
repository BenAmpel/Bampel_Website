## Abstract

Bias in news content represents a significant challenge for information systems and media analysis. This paper presents a domain-adaptive soft prompting framework for detecting multiple types of bias in news content using advanced natural language processing techniques.

Our research addresses the challenges of:
- **Multi-Type Bias Detection**: Identifying various forms of bias including political, gender, racial, and ideological bias
- **Domain Adaptation**: Adapting detection models to different news sources and contexts
- **Soft Prompting**: Using flexible prompting techniques for improved detection accuracy
- **Real-time Analysis**: Providing timely bias detection for news content

The framework demonstrates superior performance in bias detection across multiple domains while maintaining interpretability and explainability.

## Key Contributions

1. **Multi-Type Framework**: Development of comprehensive bias detection across multiple categories
2. **Domain Adaptation**: Techniques for adapting to different news sources and contexts
3. **Soft Prompting**: Innovative prompting strategies for improved detection
4. **Interpretable Results**: Providing explainable bias detection outcomes

## Research Impact

This work contributes to the development of fair and unbiased information systems and provides tools for media organizations to monitor and address bias in their content.
