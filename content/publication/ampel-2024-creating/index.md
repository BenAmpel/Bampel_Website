## Abstract

Cyber threat intelligence has become increasingly critical for organizations to defend against sophisticated attacks. This paper presents a novel deep transfer learning approach for creating proactive cyber threat intelligence using hacker exploit labels. We develop a comprehensive framework that leverages advanced machine learning techniques to analyze and classify hacker exploits for proactive threat detection.

Our research addresses the challenges of:
- **Exploit Classification**: Automated identification and categorization of hacker exploits
- **Transfer Learning**: Leveraging knowledge from related domains to improve detection
- **Proactive Intelligence**: Moving from reactive to proactive threat detection
- **Scalability**: Handling large-scale exploit datasets efficiently

The framework demonstrates significant improvements in threat detection accuracy and provides actionable intelligence for security operations.

## Key Contributions

1. **Deep Transfer Learning Framework**: Novel approach for exploit classification
2. **Proactive Intelligence**: Shift from reactive to proactive threat detection
3. **Scalable Architecture**: Efficient processing of large-scale exploit datasets
4. **Actionable Intelligence**: Generation of practical threat intelligence outputs

## Research Impact

This work advances the field of cyber threat intelligence and provides practical tools for organizations to proactively defend against cyber threats.
