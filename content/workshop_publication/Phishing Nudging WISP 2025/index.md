abstract: Email phishing remains a persistent cybersecurity threat despite advances in technical defenses. This paper presents an explainable nudging approach for email phishing prevention, combining AI-driven threat detection with human-centric interventions. Drawing on research in behavioral economics and warning science, we develop and evaluate nudging mechanisms that help users recognize and avoid phishing attempts through interpretable warnings and educational cues. Our approach addresses the need for transparency in security systems while promoting long-term user learning beyond immediate threat detection.
