abstract: Machine learning-based anti-phishing detectors are widely deployed to protect users from malicious websites. This paper presents a reinforcement learning approach to generate adversarial phishing websites that can evade these detectors, revealing potential vulnerabilities in current defense mechanisms and informing the development of more robust detection systems.
