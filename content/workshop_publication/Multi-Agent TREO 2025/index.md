abstract: This TREO talk explores provocative questions about the role of multi-agent AI systems in information systems scholarship. We examine the potential and pitfalls of AI-augmented research, discussing how multi-agent frameworks might transform academic inquiry while preserving scholarly rigor and ethical standards. Drawing on emerging paradigms like agentic services computing, we consider how role-differentiated AI agents can engage in collaborative problem-solving alongside human researchers.
