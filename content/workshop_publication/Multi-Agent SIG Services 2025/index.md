abstract: Multi-agent AI systems offer promising capabilities for enhancing information systems research. This paper presents a framework for collaborative AI-augmented inquiry, demonstrating how multiple specialized AI agents can work together to support various stages of the research process, from literature review to data analysis and interpretation. We discuss the design principles for effective multi-agent research systems, including role differentiation, coordination protocols, and human-AI collaboration patterns that preserve scholarly rigor while leveraging AI capabilities.
