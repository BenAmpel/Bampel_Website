abstract: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database and the MITRE ATT&CK framework are essential resources for cybersecurity practitioners. This paper presents a self-distillation approach to automatically link CVEs to relevant ATT&CK techniques, enabling more efficient threat assessment and prioritization of vulnerability remediation efforts.
