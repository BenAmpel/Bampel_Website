abstract: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) are used by cybersecurity analysts, networks, and endpoints managers to identify and address system vulnerabilities. The MITRE ATT&CK framework provides mitigation techniques for malicious tactics and can assist organizations in addressing their vulnerabilities. This paper presents a CVE Transformer (CVET) that uses fine-tuning and self-knowledge distillation to automatically link CVEs to relevant ATT&CK tactics, enabling more efficient threat assessment and prioritization of vulnerability remediation efforts.
