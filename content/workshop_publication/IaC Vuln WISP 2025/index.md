abstract: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has become essential for modern DevOps practices, enabling automated provisioning and management of cloud infrastructure. However, security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in IaC scripts pose significant risks to organizations. This paper explores the application of large language models (LLMs) for automatically detecting and remediating vulnerabilities in IaC configurations. We evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in identifying security weaknesses and generating secure code fixes, advancing automated security solutions for cloud infrastructure management.
