abstract: Phishing emails have emerged as one of the most common forms of social engineering attacks inflicting organizations. To combat this ever-present threat, organizations are turning toward AI-enabled phishing email detection systems (PEDS). However, the robustness of AI-enabled PEDS against adversarial text perturbations is currently unclear. In this study, we benchmark the robustness of prevailing AI-enabled PEDS against character, word, sentence, and multi-level adversarial text perturbations to quantitatively demonstrate how these systems respond to specific types of text-based attacks.
