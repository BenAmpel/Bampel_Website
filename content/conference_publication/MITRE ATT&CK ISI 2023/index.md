abstract: Paste sites serve as repositories for sharing code snippets, including malicious exploit code. Understanding how these exploits map to known attack techniques is crucial for threat intelligence. This paper presents a multi-label transformer approach to automatically map exploit code found on paste sites to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, enabling security analysts to quickly understand the potential impact and techniques employed by attackers.
