abstract: Machine learning-based phishing website detectors are increasingly deployed to protect users from malicious websites. However, these detectors remain vulnerable to adversarial evasion attacks. This paper presents an action-masked reinforcement learning approach for automated red teaming to systematically evaluate the robustness of these detectors, identifying vulnerabilities that adversaries could exploit to evade detection and informing the development of more robust defense mechanisms.
