abstract: On September 15, 2022, Ethereum shifted from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm. Did this shift lead to an increase in price and transaction volume? To answer this question, we used synthetic control methods to compare the pre and post trends of Ethereum price and volume. Our analysis revealed that Ethereum's shift from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake had a positive effect on price relative to the synthetic counterfactual, but a non-significant negative effect on transaction volume.
