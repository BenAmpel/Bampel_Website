## About Me

Dr. Benjamin M. Ampel’s research sits at the nexus of artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, with particular emphasis on large-scale text analytics for cyber-threat intelligence. Grounded in the computational design-science paradigm, his work develops and evaluates deep learning and Large Language Model (LLM) artefacts that mine adversary assets (hacker-forum posts, phishing content, and blockchain transactions) to improve cybersecurity. His research has appeared in leading outlets such as MIS Quarterly, Journal of Management Information Systems, and ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems. Dr. Ampel's research has accrued 400+ citations, and two of his conference papers have received Best Paper Awards at IEEE ISI (2020, 2023).
